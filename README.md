# Restub

Restub framework is a stub code building REST API clients with tracing support.
It uses RestSharp library and Newtonsoft.Json serializer behind the scenes.

# Getting started

## Sample code

# SDK versioning

The project uses [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning) tool to manage versions.  
Each library build can be traced back to the original git commit.

## Preparing and publishing a new release

1. Make sure that `nbgv` dotnet CLI tool is installed and is up to date
2. Run `nbgv prepare-release` to create a stable branch for the upcoming release, i.e. release/v1.0
3. Switch to the release branch: `git checkout release/v1.0`
4. Execute unit tests, update the README, etc. Commit and push your changes.
5. Run `dotnet pack -c Release` and check that it builds Nuget packages with the right version number.
6. Run `nbgv tag release/v1.0` to tag the last commit on the release branch with your current version number, i.e. v1.0.7.
7. Push tags as suggested by nbgv tool: `git push origin v1.0.7`
8. Go to github project page and create a release out of the last tag v1.0.7.
9. Verify that github workflow for publishing the nuget package has completed.
